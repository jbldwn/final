For this final, you will be using Firebase's authentication and adding it to your project. Your final project will be an e-commerce site. You must have a shopping cart, log in and create an account page and show at least 10 coffee machines.
Your project must have a create account and log-in section. There should be an icon in the top right corner of the page to show the user where to click to log in or create an account. When logged in it should give me the option to log out.
You must show a cart icon in the top right-hand corner that shows the count of how many coffee makers you have purchased. When clicked on your cart page must show all the coffee makers you have clicked the buy now button on. Your shopping cart page must have an empty cart button that will empty all products.
